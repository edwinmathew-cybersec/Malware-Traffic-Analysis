# Malware Traffic Analysis


## Objective

The objective of this lab was to create an environment where I could examine PCAPs with malicious traffic. A Windows 10 virtual machine instance was created, and the Wireshark was installed on the host. A malicious PCAP was downloaded and analyzed, simulating a real-world scenario. This hands-on lab gave me a deep understanding of Threat detection, threat hunting, and incident response.

## Skills Learned

- Understanding of malware’s purpose and how it works.
- Using IoCs to identify infections in systems.
- Knowledge of various network protocols and their security.
- Understanding of the actions that malware takes on an infected system.


## Tools Used

- 𝗪𝗶𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗸 - Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, an application that captures and helps to investigate packets from a network connection.
- 𝗩𝗶𝗿𝘂𝘀𝗧𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 - An online service that analyzes suspicious files and URLs to detect malware and malicious content using antivirus engines and website scanners.
