# Malware Traffic Analysis


## Objective

The objective of this lab was to establish an environment conducive to analyzing PCAPs containing malicious traffic. This involved setting up a Windows 10 virtual machine instance and installing Wireshark on the machine. Subsequently, a malicious PCAP file was obtained and dissected, replicating real-world scenarios of threat traffic. Through this hands-on experience, I acquired a profound comprehension of threat detection, threat-hunting methodologies, and incident response protocols.

## Skills Learned

- Familiarity with malware's objectives and functionalities, including its modes of propagation and payload delivery.
- Proficiency in utilizing Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to detect and identify infections within systems, aiding in proactive threat detection and response.
- Understanding of diverse network protocols and their security implications, enabling effective monitoring and defense against malicious activities.
- Comprehension of the behaviors and actions exhibited by malware on infected systems, facilitating efficient incident analysis and response strategies.


## Tools Used

- 𝗪𝗶𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗸 - Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, an application that captures and helps to investigate packets from a network connection.
- 𝗩𝗶𝗿𝘂𝘀𝗧𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 - An online service that analyzes suspicious files and URLs to detect malware and malicious content using antivirus engines and website scanners.
